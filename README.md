<h3>Lazy Homework Scraper</h3>

Being lazy to login in to moodle and go one by one on each subject to check my homework due date, I wrote this script to login to my moodle, get my courses, and check for each homework due date. When its done getting the due dates, its linked with my gmail account and uses third party google keep api and creates notes on Google Keep and syncs all the data. And the homework due dates are displayed on my phone.

<strong>How To Use?</strong>
This will only work for any college students whose college follow the moodle website. This may not be 100% accurate. It's totally based on how your professor put the homework.

1. Download All Files.
2. Open credentials.txt and write down your moodle username, password and gmail email, password like shown in the example below:

testusername<br>
testpassword<br>
test@gmail.com<br>
testgmailpassword<br>

3. Save it. Now Run main.py
4. After the script is run successfully, access your google keep from your phone or laptop to check the homeworks.
